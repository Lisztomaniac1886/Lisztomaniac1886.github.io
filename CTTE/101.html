<p>In 1946 German scientist Dieter Koehler and his little girl Lotte are brought to London from Germany by captain Cal Ferguson of the secret service's T-force in the hopes of persuading Dieter to work for the RAF in developing the jet engine ahead of the Russians but Dieter is not keen to cooperate and Lotte is unhappy and home-sick. Cal also has to deal with unstable younger brother Victor, traumatized by war service and Kathy Griffiths from the War Crimes Department, keen to locate fugitive Nazis that T-force may unwittingly be aiding. At the Connington hotel where the Koehlers are staying Cal makes the acquaintance of fellow guest Harold Lindsay-Jones and American cabaret singer Eva. In fact Eva is reopening the bomb- damaged basement bar with its first concert since before the war but Lotte takes advantage of the entertainment to run away, bumping into a sinister man she met on first arriving in England.</p>
