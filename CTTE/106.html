<p>Victor, still struggling to cope with the effects of the war, tries to expose the activities of Callum's team. Those around him choose not to pay attention and force him to seek medical help. He escapes from the hospital psychiatric ward at an opportune moment, while Callum and Rachel take advantage of Alex's upcoming business trip. When Callum's superiors try to stop Victor, his life is threatened.</p>

<p>Dieter finally tells Callum the truth about his past in Germany. The tables have turned, and it is now Dieter who tries to win over Callum. Harold similarly feels despair for failing to live up to Callum's expectations of him. Can these two men convince Callum of their integrity?</p>
